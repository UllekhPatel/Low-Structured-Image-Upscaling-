# Low-Structured-Image-Upscaling-
Image Upscaling Project

Overview

This project focuses on enhancing low-resolution images using different image upscaling techniques. Upscaling is crucial for applications requiring high-resolution images, such as photography, video processing, and digital displays. We explore various interpolation algorithms to improve image clarity and detail.

Techniques Implemented
1) Hierarchical Filling:
Description: Enhances resolution by resizing and filling in details through residuals. This method balances speed and quality.
2) Fast Adaptive Upscaling:
Description: Utilizes adaptive filtering with Gaussian blurring to upscale images efficiently, focusing on local pixel information.
3) Bicubic Interpolation:
Description: Uses 16 surrounding pixels to create smooth gradients, resulting in high-quality images.
4) Bilinear Interpolation:
Description: Considers the nearest 4 pixels for interpolation, offering faster processing but potentially less detail.
5) Nearest Neighbor Interpolation:
Description: Simplest method that selects the nearest pixel value, leading to blocky images at high scales.

Objectives
1) Compare the performance and visual quality of each upscaling technique.
2) Analyze execution time to identify the most efficient method.
3) Provide visual comparisons for better understanding and decision-making.

Results
1) Hierarchical Filling: Moderate speed, good detail preservation.
2) Fast Adaptive Upscaling: Fastest method, suitable for real-time applications.
3) Bicubic Interpolation: High-quality images, slower processing time.
4) Bilinear Interpolation: Fast processing, less detail.
5) Nearest Neighbor: Fastest but lowest quality.

Conclusion

This project provides insights into the trade-offs between image quality and processing time across various upscaling methods, aiding in selecting the best approach for specific applications.
