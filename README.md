# Low-Structured-Image-Upscaling-
Image Upscaling Project

Overview

This project focuses on enhancing low-resolution images using different image upscaling techniques. Upscaling is crucial for applications requiring high-resolution images, such as photography, video processing, and digital displays. We explore various interpolation algorithms to improve image clarity and detail.

Techniques Implemented

	1.	Hierarchical Filling:
	•	Description: Enhances resolution by resizing and filling in details through residuals. This method balances speed and quality.
	•	Application: Useful for applications requiring fine detail preservation.
	2.	Fast Adaptive Upscaling:
	•	Description: Utilizes adaptive filtering with Gaussian blurring to upscale images efficiently, focusing on local pixel information.
	•	Application: Ideal for real-time processing in video streaming or conferencing.
	3.	Bicubic Interpolation:
	•	Description: Uses 16 surrounding pixels to create smooth gradients, resulting in high-quality images.
	•	Application: Best for tasks demanding high-quality images, like professional photo editing.
	4.	Bilinear Interpolation:
	•	Description: Considers the nearest 4 pixels for interpolation, offering faster processing but potentially less detail.
	•	Application: Suitable for quick image previews or thumbnails.
	5.	Nearest Neighbor Interpolation:
	•	Description: Simplest method that selects the nearest pixel value, leading to blocky images at high scales.
	•	Application: Fastest method for non-critical image scaling, such as small icons.

Objectives

	•	Compare the performance and visual quality of each upscaling technique.
	•	Analyze execution time to identify the most efficient method.
	•	Provide visual comparisons for better understanding and decision-making.

Results

	•	Hierarchical Filling: Moderate speed, good detail preservation.
	•	Fast Adaptive Upscaling: Fastest method, suitable for real-time applications.
	•	Bicubic Interpolation: High-quality images, slower processing time.
	•	Bilinear Interpolation: Fast processing, less detail.
	•	Nearest Neighbor: Fastest but lowest quality.

Conclusion

This project provides insights into the trade-offs between image quality and processing time across various upscaling methods, aiding in selecting the best approach for specific applications.
